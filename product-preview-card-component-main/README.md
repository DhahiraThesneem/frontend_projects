## Overview

- I have used Tailwind CSS to design the component, which is used to display the product in desktop and mobile view.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page,
- view the product in both mobile and desktop,

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsible Design

### What I learned

- I have understood how to customized line-height in Tailwind CSS 

```html
<script>
    tailwind.config = {
      theme: {
        extend: {
          lineHeight: {
            'extra-tight': '1',
            '4': '1rem',
            'relaxed-cus' : '1.75',
            '12': '3rem,'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  </script>
```

### Continued development

- In this project, I have directly applied Tailwind CSS from scratch. In future project, I want to use Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for learing Tailwind CSS.
